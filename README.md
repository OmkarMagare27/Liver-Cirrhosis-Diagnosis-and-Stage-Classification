# Liver-Cirrhosis-Diagnosis-and-Stage-Classification
This project aims to develop machine learning models for diagnosing liver cirrhosis and classifying its stages using clinical and biochemical data. The dataset contains 25,000 patient records with demographic, clinical, and biochemical attributes, and the goal is to predict the severity of liver cirrhosis to assist in clinical decision-making.
